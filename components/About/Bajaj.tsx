        Founded in 1926, at the height of India’s movement for independence from
        the British, the group has an illustrious history. The integrity,
        dedication, resourcefulness and determination to succeed which are
        characteristic of the group today, are often traced back to its birth
        during those days of relentless devotion to a common cause. Jamnalal
        Bajaj, founder of the group, was a close confidant and disciple of
        Mahatma Gandhi. In fact, Gandhiji had adopted him as his son.

      <p>
        This close relationship and his deep involvement in the independence
        movement did not leave Jamnalal Bajaj with much time to spend on his
        newly launched business venture. We are celebrating 125th Birth
        anniversary of Shri. Jamnalal Bajaj on 4th of November 2014.

        His son, Kamalnayan Bajaj, then 27, took over the reigns of business in
        1942. He too was close to Gandhiji and it was only after Independence in
        1947, that he was able to give his full attention to the business.
        Kamalnayan Bajaj not only consolidated the group, but also diversified
        into various manufacturing activities.

        The present Chairman of the group, Rahul Bajaj, took charge of the
        business in 1965. Under his leadership, the turnover of the Bajaj Auto
        the flagship company has gone up from INR.72 million to INR. 120
        billion, its product portfolio has expanded and the brand has found a

        In 2005, Rahul Bajaj’s son Rajiv Bajaj stepped into the shoes of
        Managing Director of Bajaj Auto and steered the organization to becoming
        a global automobile behemoth. He introduced the Pulsar range of bikes,
        that revolutionised the two wheeler market in India. The legacy of our
        Auto Rickshaws have been soaring heights and display unparalleled market
        dominance across any automobile segment.

        In 2007, Bajaj Auto acquired a 14% stake in KTM that has since grown to
        48%. This partnership catalysed Bajaj Auto’s endeavour to democratise

        Duke range of KTM bikes and exports them worldwide. In FY2018, KTM was
        the fastest growing motorcycle brand in the country
